## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vailla JS
- Figma

### What I learned

In this project i practice my skills in CSS specially using flexbox to layout the news. I put into practice my programming logic using JS to toggle the menu on mobile.

Some code i'm proud of:

```js
openIcon.addEventListener('click', () => {
    mobileMenu.classList.remove('mobile-menu-container-close');
    mobileMenu.classList.add('mobile-menu-container');
    mobileLayer.classList.add('mobile-bg-layer');
    mobileLayer.classList.remove('mobile-bg-layer-hide');
})
```

### Continued development

Definitely i want to work on my skills in JavaScript and CSS by continuing building projects and also want to learn a JS framework/library like REACT or Angular.
